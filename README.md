# Detecting-Outliers
A ML algorithm to detect and visualize outliers in a dataset. <hr>
In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations.[1][2] An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error; the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set.[3] An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses.<br>
Outliers increase the variance in the dataset which inturn results in the decrease in the statistical power. So it is very important to identify these outliers and treat them accordingly.<hr>
